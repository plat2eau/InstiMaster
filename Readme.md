# InstiMaster

## Overview

**InstiMaster** is a sophisticated backend application designed for the efficient management of institutes. It offers a comprehensive set of REST APIs to facilitate the complete lifecycle of institutes, encompassing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. With a robust login system and access control mechanisms based on user roles, **InstiMaster** ensures secure operations. Security features include protection against potential attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through the implementation of security tools like JSON Web Token (JWT), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The application seamlessly integrates with **PostgreSQL 16** as its backend database.
